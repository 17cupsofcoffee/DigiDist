This is a simple little VST plugin, developed in Rust using the [`vst2` crate](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-vst2/). It doesn't sound particularly great, but it demonstrates just how easy this set of tools makes it to put together a working audio plugin - I was able to create this in a few hours, with no prior knowledge of the VST spec!
